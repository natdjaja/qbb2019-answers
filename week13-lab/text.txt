Chromosome conformation
Cis-regulatory modules interacting with target promoters
Elements sitting on chromatin, and folding up of chromatin to form long range connections with DNA that is not nearby in a linear sequence
You can use FISH to see how close DNA are in space as well
But FISH is low throughput, it has limited resolution, and there are a limited number of unique channels
How can we turn this into a sequencing problem then to resolve these issues?
Chromatin conformation capture (3C) that allows you to look at things that are spatially close together, mediated by some sort of protein or complex
You get hybrid fragments of DNA that are close together
HiC similar but with biotin and you randomly fragment
This is an approach to map the whole genome and to see which DNA fragments are close together
A binary switch of things in the genome that are contacting each other or not
Large scale organization into two compartments (active/inactive)
Distance distribution consistent with "fractal globule"
Rate of decay of signal suggest what kind of structure is being fomrmed inside the nucleus
We can also assess topologically associated domains that are highly self-interacting and have boundaries that exist outside of that
TADs help to define the regulatory landscape of the genome
They are really conserved across cell types too
CTCF defines the boundaries of TADs!
It does it in a very specific and oriented way

Single-cell HiC relies on different context for every specific region that you're looking for
HiC immuno-precipitation
Before you sequence your DNA, you add an antibody for a protein that you may have and see where it is enriched in your DNA sequence

Non Hi-C approaches
Genome architecture mapping (GAM)
Split-pool reocnigition of interactions by tag extension
TSA-seq (tyramid signal amplification sequencing)

GAM: take a whole slice of a nucleus
May things within that sequence will either be super close or far apart
You then count how many times each pair of things occurred in a slice
You do get some single cell information from this
More so, you get clusters of things that are co-occurring

Sprite thinks of things in the units of interaction hubs
You digest your genome, crosslink with proteins, and then you dilute it and spread out as blocks of protein-digested chromatin across a 96-well plate that further allows you to use different oligo-labels to append to each DNA
This creates your custom random barcodes

TSA-seq gives you a protein of interest, labeled with a horseradish peroxidase (creating free radicals that diffuse out in space and create a bond bewteen biotin and chromatin)
We want to know this to see how genes are correlated to regulatory elements

This is all useful for genome assembly, structural variation (compare to cancer), assessing regulatory landscape
Structural variation detection

Two things influence how enhancers drive transcription: the strength of the enhancer, and the proximity of the enhancer to your gene
How frequently is it interacting wtih your gene

G1E cell line, bin into 5kb bins 
We have activity level, the coding RNA, and the scale of the chromosome which it is on
Can we use enhancer elements to predict gene expression?
